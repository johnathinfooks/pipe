Imagine a functional programming language that is as easy to write as C but as smart and cool as Haskell...

Doing this for a learning experience <3

Very very good book

# overview
Look at BRAINSTORM.md for inspiration of the syntax. Basically, I want a programming language where the heart of what it does is making it very easy to know for sure what is going on under the hood and for it to be very easy to manage data. This includes very purposeful input/output type declaration and functional programming restrictions. However, this will not be a functional programming language. The language will not have global state, forcing the user to remain aware of writing good programs. However, within functions, there are variables and loops with state that write like C (memory management, bit manipulation, mathematics, etc.). The language should be very simple with a large standard and mathematical library that make it more useful.
